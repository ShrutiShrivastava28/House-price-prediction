# House-price-prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on various factors such as location, size, and market trends. It utilizes machine learning techniques implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Overview
The prediction model was developed using a dataset containing information about past house sales, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood details. By analyzing this data and training machine learning algorithms, the model can estimate the selling price of a property.

Features
Data Exploration: Analyzed and visualized the dataset to understand patterns and correlations.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implemented regression techniques to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the prediction model using relevant metrics.
Deployment: Demonstrated the usage of the model in practical scenarios.

Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook files containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Documentation: Additional resources, such as project requirements and guides.
